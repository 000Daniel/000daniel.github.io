This site is built to provide documentation about topics in the C# programming language that I personally feel don't get enough coverage.<br><br>
The purpose of these pages is to make said niche topics easy to understand and easy to utilize in your programming projects.<br><br>
Some of the documents focus on the <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot game engine</a>.<br>
The recent popularity and growth boost in the Godot game engine made me realise just how lacking some of the C# documentations are. And so it inspired me to make this site.<br>
