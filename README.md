# General C# Documentation
This site is built to provide documentation about topics in the C# programming language that I personally feel don't get enough coverage.

The purpose of these documentations is to encourage more people to use the C# programming language and help them with niche subjects.

If you find errors in this site, please report them over to the relevant GitHub repository.
